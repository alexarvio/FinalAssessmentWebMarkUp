                <h3>What Are Solar Panels?</h3>
                <p>Solar panels are used to convert light form the sun into electricity. The sun's light is composed of particles of energy called "photons". When the light reaches the panels, the photons are absorbed initiating like this an electric current. The panels are comprised of several individual solar cells which are themselves composed of layers of silicon, phosphorous and boron.</p>

                <h3>The Charge Controller</h3>
                <p>A solar charge controller manages the power going into the battery. It is crucial because it ensures that the deep cycle batteries dont get overcharged during the day. There are controllers available to the public that have the ability to control lightning</p>

                <h3>The Battery System</h3>
                <p>The popularity of solar power growing has led to the rise of another technology: solar batteries. These batteries can store extra solar power for later use. Companies such as Tesla are developing these batteries that can be installed with the solar panels.</p>

                <h3>DC Power</h3>
                <p>DC refers to direct current. The array of photovoltaic power system which is a system designed to supply usable solar power produces DC power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. The amount of actions you can do with DC is quite limited and that is why it usually requires conversion to certain desired volatges or to alternating current (AC) through the use of inverters.</p>

                <h3>Inverter</h3>
                <p>A solar inverter is a type of electrical converter which converts the DC output of a solar panel into alternating current (AC) that can be sent into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local electrical network. Solar power inverters have special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic arrays, including maximum power pooint tracking and anti-islanding protection.</p>

                <h3>AC Power</h3>
                <p>Alternating current is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current. AC is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences. And it is the form of energy that consumers typically use when they plug househould appliances.</p>
